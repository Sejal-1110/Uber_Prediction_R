# Uber_Prediction_R
Developed a machine learning model with Uber's pickup data to forecast ride demand using Python and time series analysis.

Introduction

Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for ridesharing companies like Uber to ensure adequate supply of drivers to meet passenger demand. The ability to anticipate periods of high demand allows strategic allocation of drivers across a city. In this project, we develop a data-driven model to forecast near-term demand for Uber rides.

Data

The raw data used consists of Uber pickup information for three months - April, May and June 2014 for New York City. The data contains timestamps of pickups accurate to the minute.

Tools/Techniques

The following tools and techniques are used:

Data Manipulation: The dplyr R package is used for data wrangling tasks like combining the data from multiple months into a single dataframe, dealing with dates, removing missing values etc.
Time Series Forecasting: Facebook Prophet, a library for time series forecasting is used to fit a model on the daily pickup count timeseries and generate forecasts.
Visualization: The ggplot2 and ggthemes libraries provide capabilities for flexible graphs and styled themes for visualizing the data.
Reporting: Forecast outputs are exported to Excel using the writexl package for generating reports.

Methodology

The overall steps followed are:

Data Cleaning: Raw pickup data from individual months is combined and cleaned. Dates are converted to datetime format and missing values are removed.
Feature Engineering: The dataset is aggregated by day and the number of daily pickups is counted. This serves as the timeseries for modeling.
Time Series Modeling: A Prophet model is fitted on the daily pickup count timeseries. The model automatically accounts for trends, seasonality and holidays.
Prediction: The fitted model is used to forecast pickup demand for the next 30 days.
Reporting: The 30 day forecast output is exported to an Excel file for easy reporting.

Results

The Prophet model provides a 30 day forecast of expected daily Uber ride demand. This information can help Uber anticipate periods of high demand and low demand. The forecasts can inform driver scheduling and supply management decisions.

The Excel output makes it easy to visualize and share the results with stakeholders. The same modeling process can be applied repeatedly to generate updated forecasts every month.

Conclusion

In this project, we developed an end-to-end system to forecast near-term demand for Uber rides. The results demonstrate how data analytics and machine learning techniques can generate actionable insights for ridesharing platforms. The Prophet forecasting approach delivers accurate demand forecasts with very little manual effort compared to traditional statistical methods.

Some ways to extend this work could be incorporating additional data like weather, events data to improve forecast accuracy. The model parameters could also be tuned further. Setting up automated pipelines to re-run the forecasting every month would make the system more useful in practice.
